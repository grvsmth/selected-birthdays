Google Calendar automatically creates a "Birthdays" calendar with the birthdays of all your contacts and the people you follow on Google+. But what if you only want to know about some of their birthdays? Now you can create your own calendar showing only the birthdays you want to see from your contacts list.

Created by Angus B. Grieve-Smith using the APIs for Google+ and Google Calendar, with moment.js for date and time handling and bootflat for design. If you like this app, you can fork the source on GitHub

This app does not change any existing calendars; it only creates a new one and optionally hides the default Birthdays calendar. All these changes can be undone in your calendar settings. The app also does not reveal your contact or calendar information to anyone but you and Google.
